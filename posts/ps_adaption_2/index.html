			<p>Here&rsquo;s a concise account of my first day of sleep experimentation:</p>
<p>Despite attempts, I was unable to take a nap on Day 1. Falling asleep during the day proved more difficult than expected. However, when it came to the core sleep period, I had no issues drifting off.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I awoke at 3:21 AM, a nearly 10 minutes before my alarm was due to ring. It&rsquo;s fascinating how attuned our bodies can be to internal rhythms.</p>
<p>Upon waking, I felt moderately fresh. I wouldn&rsquo;t describe myself as fully revitalized, but I wasn&rsquo;t dragging either - somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>As I step into Day 2, I&rsquo;m hoping to successfully include a nap in my routine. Stay tuned to see if the elusive daytime sleep becomes a reality!</p>
