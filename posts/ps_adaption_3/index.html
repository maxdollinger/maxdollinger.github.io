			<p>Today, my adaptation journey went moderately well. In the morning, I was fortunate enough to enjoy a refreshing nap. However, during my second scheduled nap, sleep eluded me. As a result, I found myself battling fatigue throughout the afternoon.</p>
<p>Around midday, a throbbing headache set in, adding to my feelings of misery.
Maybe it&rsquo;s a symptom of the cold turkey caffeine withdrawal. The combination of a headache and tiredness made it difficult to concentrate and enjoy my day.</p>
<p>Thankfully, as the day progressed, I started to feel better. By evening, I felt a surge of energy, and my mood lifted.</p>
<p>However, as bedtime approached, I unintentionally dozed off at around 10 pm, an hour earlier than my schedule. Surprisingly, I awoke naturally at 3:28 in the morning, without any need for an alarm.</p>
<p>So far, the adaptation to the “Everyman 2” pattern seems to be going fine.</p>
