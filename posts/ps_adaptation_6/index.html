			<p>Getting up today was decent. I&rsquo;m not feeling exhausted, but I&rsquo;m also not rested. Interestingly, I woke up after 4.5 hours of sleep at 2:30 a.m. and felt ready to get up. Maybe the 4.5-hour core block is more natural for me. Eventually, I will experiment with a biphasic schedule.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I made some positive progress in managing my caffeine withdrawal symptoms. Instead of going cold turkey, I decided to take a more gradual approach. Today, I drank half a cup of weak coffee, which helped alleviate the withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p>Remarkably, I didn&rsquo;t experience any fatigue throughout the entire day. Despite not taking a nap, I managed to maintain my energy levels and stay productive.</p>
<p>Moving forward, my plan is to continue reducing the amount of coffee I consume. Once I can go two consecutive days without any withdrawal symptoms, I intend to return to the “Everyman 2” (E2) sleep schedule, which aligns better with my desired sleep pattern.</p>
