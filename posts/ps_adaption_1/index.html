			<p>Being a new parent and trying to balance work, college, and spending time with my little girl has led to an increased need for time. Preferably at night.Polyphasic sleep can help me get the most rest while still having enough time to do my work and spend time with my child.</p>
<p>Polyphasic sleep is a sleep pattern that deviates from the traditional monophasic sleep pattern of one long, continuous period at night.
Instead, it involves breaking sleep into multiple shorter sleep periods throughout the day.
One specific Polyphasic sleep schedule is known as Polyphasic sleep E2.</p>
<p>Polyphasic sleep E2 (E2 for short) consists of one core sleep period and two strategically timed naps.
I decided to pursue this schedule as it is known to be relatively easy to adapt to, and I typically sleep for 6 to 8 hours.</p>
<p>To transition to the E2 schedule, I opted for the “cold turkey” method, making an abrupt shift from my previous sleep routine. My core sleep period was set from 23:00 to 3:30, followed by a short nap from 7:40 to 8:00. The timing of the second nap varied depending on when my daughter would take her nap, typically between 13:00 and 14:00.</p>
<p>On the first night of my E2 adaptation, from June 16th to June 17th, I established a bedtime routine to promote better sleep. I refrained from using electronic devices before bed, took a relaxing shower, and engaged in an awareness exercise to calm my mind before sleep.</p>
<p>Waking up the next morning was surprisingly great. I experienced no difficulties getting out of bed and felt a sense of rejuvenation. Although I felt fresh overall, there was a slight hint of sleepiness, which is expected during the initial stages of adapting to a new sleep pattern.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my initial experience with the E2 schedule has been promising. I am eager to continue.</p>
