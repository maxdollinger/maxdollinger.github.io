			<p>Caffeine withdrawal can have a significant impact on our well-being, and I experienced this firsthand. Yesterday, the withdrawal symptoms hit me hard, with terrible headaches and overwhelming tiredness. In an effort to cope with this, I decided to switch to the “Everyman 1” sleep schedule.</p>
<p>Under this new schedule, I aimed for 6 hours of core sleep from 22:00 to 4:00, followed by a midday nap. While adjusting to the new routine, I noticed that getting out of bed at 4 a.m. after 6 hours of sleep felt a bit more difficult than expected. However, the interesting part was that, despite the initial challenge, my body felt considerably more rested compared to my previous sleep schedule.</p>
<p>I hope this shift in sleep pattern allows me to manage the caffeine withdrawal symptoms more effectively. I plan to go back to the E2 schedule once the withdrawal symptoms subside.</p>
<p>This reminded me that we need to pay attention to our body&rsquo;s signals and make necessary adjustments.</p>
