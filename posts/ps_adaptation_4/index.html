			<p>On Day 3, during my first scheduled nap, I found it difficult to fall asleep. Despite feeling tired, my mind seemed to resist the embrace of sleep. However, things took a positive turn during my midday nap. I was able to enjoy a good nap.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as the day progressed, I again experienced mild headaches during midday and early afternoon. These headaches, combined with a constant feeling of tiredness and weakness, made it challenging to stay focused and productive. Nonetheless, as the evening approached, the headaches started to subside, bringing some relief.</p>
<p>When it was time for my core sleep, I faced difficulty falling asleep as quickly as I had the previous day. This delayed onset of sleep prolonged the time it took for me to enter a deep, restorative sleep state.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I started questioning whether this adaptation is worth it. But for now, I will continue and see what the next few days will be like. Eventually, I will extend the core sleep time by one cycle to 6 hours and only nap once a day.</p>
<p>This morning, getting up was a bit harder; I unintentionally overslept by half an hour, waking up at 4 a.m. I still felt a bit fatigued upon awakening.</p>
